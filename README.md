# Backtrack Shell Scripts

## Update:
This has been discontinued.  Instead I'm going to maintain Kali scripts here: https://github.com/secjohn/kali-scripts.

Kali is the new version of backtrack and if you haven't switched over yet you should.  Check it out: http://www.kali.org/

## Overview
This is simply a place for me to store shell scripts to make my life easier using backtrack.  Hopfully others will find them useful and even contribute to them.

### btupdate.sh
This is a simple update script, I purposfully kept it simple and easy to read with a lot of echo's to the screen so people newer to shell scripting could understand it and easily update it adding the tools they want to keep updated.  Simply it:

1. Updates the system
2. Updates several tools I use often enough to want to keep up to date.

I hope someone out there finds it useful to see and I hope people contribute back and I would love to see what tools other people like.

Note: This script was not tested on any BT build before BT5rc2.
